Super easy to use:

unpack BepInEx to the game folder as in this install guide https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html

then place the mod in the Dustland Delivery/BepInEX/plugins/ folder

Now when the game runs BepInEx also runs, and loads the mods.  A config file is created at first run at Dustland Delivery/BepInEX/plugins/DDTweaks.cfg
edit the numbers in there and re-run the game
