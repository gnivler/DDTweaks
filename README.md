Super easy to use:

unpack BepInEx5 `x64` to the game folder as in this install guide https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html

then place the mod in the `Dustland Delivery/BepInEX/plugins/` folder

Now when the game runs BepInEx also runs, and loads the mods.  

__A config file is created at first run at `Dustland Delivery/BepInEX/plugins/DDTweaks.cfg`__

__edit that as needed, and re-run the game__
